github now has 'main' not 'master' as the default branch name.




Pulling from Github

As we added the README.md in our repo, we need to first pull that file to our local repository to check that we haven't got a 'conflict'.

git pull origin master

git status

git add .

git commit -m "README.md" 	<<< I think this line should move to ...

Once we have done this, you should see the README file on your computer.

ls

Open it up and type some kind of modification/addition.

git add .

				<<< ... here.

Now you can push your changes:

git push origin master

Refresh your GitHub webpage, and the files should be there.
